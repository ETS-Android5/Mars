# Code Description
Below is an outline of our code and how we structured the application

- all navigation is in top level App.js
- each individual .js file is its own component e.g. loading.js is loading screen, intro.js is intro screen, sleepDiary.js is sleep diary screen


## Chatbot breakdown
screens/chat-screen/home.js is where the chatbot screen lives
